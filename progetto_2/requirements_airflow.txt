To resolve the issue and proceed with running Airflow in standalone mode, you can follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Create a virtual environment for Airflow. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
python -m venv airflow-env
Activate the virtual environment. In the same terminal or command prompt, run the appropriate command based on your operating system:

For Windows:
Copy code
airflow-env\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source airflow-env/bin/activate
Install Airflow and its dependencies. Run the following command:

Copy code
pip install apache-airflow
Update SQLAlchemy to a version compatible with Airflow. Run the following command:

arduino
Copy code
pip install "sqlalchemy<2.0"
Initialize the Airflow database. Run the following command:

csharp
Copy code
airflow db init
Start the Airflow web server. Run the following command:

css
Copy code
airflow webserver --port 8080
At this point, the Airflow web server should be running on port 8080. You can access the Airflow UI by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
